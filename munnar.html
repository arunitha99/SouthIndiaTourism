Munnar, the famed hill station of south India, is a romantic locale where natural beauty is everywhere to visit, explore and to enjoy.<br> Munnar is situated at the confluence of three mountain streams – Muthirapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala – and the word ‘Munnar’ means three rivers in Malayalam.  Situated about 1600m above sea level, the hill station had been the summer resort of the British Government during the colonial era. Imprints of the colonial past stand tall in the Munnar town in the form of English country cottages. Virgin forests, savannah, rolling hills, scenic valleys, numerous streams, huge splashy waterfalls, sprawling tea plantations and winding walkways are all part of the great holiday experience on offer for a traveler to Munnar. Munnar is also known for Neelakurinji, a rare plant which flowers only once in twelve years. The ‘kurinji season’ in Munnar is a magnificent sight when the hills and valleys get bathed in the blue of the Neelakurinji blooms.

	<br>
	The Government of Kerala, in a noble initiative to protect the Neelakurinji and the unique biodiversity of the region, declared around 32 sq km area in the Kottakamboor and Vattavada villages in Munnar as the Neelakurinji National Park. The initiative was welcomed by conservationists and nature lovers from around the world.

The declaration was made in Munnar in 2006, the last time Neelakurinji bloomed on the hills. The 2006 season saw some 10 lakh travellers from in and around the country visiting Munnar to watch the rare beauty.
