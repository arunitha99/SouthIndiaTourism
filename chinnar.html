	The Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary is a well-guarded treasure trove of nearly a thousand species of flowering plants. Its not just flora, the Chinnar forest is also home to a thriving animal life. From birds and butterflies to mammals and moths, the 90.44-sq km sanctuary is home to a wide variety of species. It is also credited with having the largest number of reptilian fauna among other sanctuaries in the state, including a celebrated inhabitant - the mugger crocodile.

The Thoovanam waterfall, a spectacular waterfall located in the sanctuary, is also an attraction for travellers. A watchtower in the sanctuary offers an unbelievably beautiful view of the sanctuary, vast expanses of green forests extending to the nearby state of Tamil Nadu and far away mountains. The sanctuary, a trekkerâ€™s paradise, is situated about 60 km away from Munnar and the Munnar-Udumalpet road passes through the sanctuary.<br> <br>

Trekking
The sanctuary offers a host of trekking options to know the wild. There is a two-night and three-day trek option in which travellers can explore the woods and visit some pre-historic sites known for cave paintings and dolmenoids. Another interesting option is the trek to Vysiapara which includes an overnight stay in a thatched hut atop a scenic hill. Visit to tribal settlements is part of both the options. For those who are on a short holidaying, a one-day trek is offered which includes bird watching.    

The treks are organized by the Department of Forests and Wildlife in association with Eco-development committees formed by tribal communities. It is strongly recommended to contact the Eco-development Committee or Sanctuary authorities to plan the options well in advance.
