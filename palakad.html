Palakkad District, in the southeastern part of the former Malabar district, is one of the 14 districts of the Indian state of Kerala. It is located right in the middle of the state. Also, it is the largest district in Kerala since 2006. The city of Palakkad is the district headquarters. Palakkad is bordered on the northwest by the Malappuram District, on the southwest by the Thrissur District, on the northeast by Nilgiris District, and on the east by Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu. The district is nicknamed "the granary of Kerala". Palakkad is the gateway to Kerala due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap, in the Western Ghats.

	Mangalavanam is an ecologically sensitive area situated at the centre of the Indian city of Kochi, covering about 2.74 hectares.[1] It also houses a shallow tidal lake connected with Kochi backwaters by a canal. It is situated behind the Kerala High Court building. It is a nesting ground for a large variety of migratory birds and supports many types of mangroves. The Managalavanam is often regarded as the "green lung of Kochi",[2] considering its role in keeping the city's air pollution under check. The area is a roosting place for many kinds of resident and migratory birds.
