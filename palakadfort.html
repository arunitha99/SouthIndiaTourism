This is the place for the people who want to connect with the history of Palakkad. Commonly known as Tipuâ€™s Fort, the gigantic Palakkad Fort is located in the heart of the city. The glorious attraction of Kerala, Palakkad Fort woos tourists with its mesmerizing architecture. Built by Haider Ali in 1766 AD, the fort campus houses Hanuman (Anjaneya) Temple, which will surely leave you spellbound with its unique interiors.

Rising above a tiny hill, historians say that the colossal architecture was built as a purpose of improving communication between Palakkad and Coimbatore. Today this Fort is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. The sober majesty of the Fort walls reminds one of the old tales of valor and courage. Presently, the fort is serene, filled with art and offers a spectacular view of the surrounding area.
