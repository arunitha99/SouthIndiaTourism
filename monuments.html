                    monument is said to have been built before pre-Islamic times but to follow Islamic engineering in an
                    unusual way.<br><br> It has a rounded base and is operated by a black trap with a large clock
                    mounted, which
                    can be reached by a wandering eighty step. The clock tower serves as a point of view and measures 71
                    meters in length. This tube-shaped structure offers a breathtaking view of the city from the top.

                    Halebidu is an ancient site in the district of Hassan in Karnataka. In the 12th and 13th centuries,
                    Halebidu was the capital of the Hoysala Empire. It is a city full of historic buildings. Most of the
                    monuments are ruins in the present day.

                    Halebidu is famous for the temples built in the Hoysala architecture. The temples and the shrines
                    are carved and engraved with precision. There are intricate details in every sculpture that attracts
                    the attention of the tourists. Hoysaleswara temple, Shantaleswara temple, and Kedareshwara temple
                    are top on the list. Visit Basadi Halli for the Jain temples, Belur, Yagachi Dam, and the
                    Archaeological Museum to complete the trip.

                    Located on the bank south of the Tungabhadra River, Hampi is a historic town that continues to be a
                    common tourist destination in North Karnataka and gloves once the seat of the Kingdom of
                    Vijayanagara. <br><br>The city is said to have been built between AD 1336 – 1570. A major
                    development is
                    thought to have been completed during the reign of Raja Krishnadeva Raya, the main leader of the
                    movement.<br><br> Today, although Hampi lies in the remains it is still a symbol of rich design and
                    the
                    power of building huge structures. Among the rebuilt buildings in Hampi is the Virupaksha Temple.
                    Spread over 25 sq km there are a lot of cut stone structures where you see what you will be confused
                    about.

                    Hospet, officially known as Hosapete, is a city in the Bellary district of central Karnataka. It is
                    close to Hampi. The word ‘Hospete’ means a new city. It has historical significance because it was
                    built by Krishna Deva Raya, the king of the Vijayanagara dynasty. Hospet was a dedication by the
                    king to his mother. It was earlier called Nagalapura. The river Tungabhadra flows by the city.

                    Hospet is known as the Fort Town of Karnataka. It is famous for the Chitradurga Fort, also known as
                    the Palace of Stone or “Kallina Kote”. The fort alone contains 19 temples. The city of Hospet is

                    Wouldn’t you love a journey back into history? The 12th century capital of the Hoysala Empire,
                    Halebidu does just that. Home to a number of heritage monuments in Karnataka, the city is truly
                    fascinating in every way. Fining its mention on our list is, one of the finest examples of Hoysala
                    architecture, Hoysaleswara Temple. In fact the temple is acclaimed as ‘the supreme climax of Indian
                    architceture’.

                    Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the incredible Dravidian temple is known for carvings and sculptures that
                    bring to life the mythological deities of Indian culture. The metal like polishing must be seen to
                    believe how even stones can be greatest of treasures. Pay a visit to take blessings of the Lord but
                    definitely to pay homage to the craftsmanship of the temple artisans.<br><br>

                    Kedareshwar temple is in Halebeedu, Hassan district of Karnataka. Hoysala King Veera Ballala II
                    built the temple during his rule (1173-1220 A.D.). The Archaeological Survey of India has marked the
                    temple as a monument of national importance.

                    Although the Kedareshwar temple is a dedication to Lord Shiva, it is also a Trikuta temple. Trikuta
                    refers to the shrine of three major deities in India – Lord Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma. The temple
                    walls are full of sculptures of holy figures that depict religious stories of Ramayana, Mahabharata,
                    and Bhagavad Gita.

                    Every nook and corner of the temple holds a character from the Hindu scriptures. The pillars towards
                    the entrance are star-shaped and make one wonder about the technology used in that era. Kedareshwara
                    temple is a window to our religious and cultural past.
