            <span class="history-caption">"Telangana, as a geographical and political entity was born on June 2, 2014 as the 29th and the youngest state in Union of India. 
                 In the historical age, Telangana had given rise to mighty empires and kingdoms like the Satavahanas, 
                 Vakatakas, Ikshvakus, Vishnukundins, Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, Qutb Shahis and Asif Jahis."</span>

            <h3 class="history-heading2">Etymology</h3>
            <p class="history-para">
                The name "Telangana" refers to the word Trilinga Desa, 
                earned due to the presence of three ancient Shiva Temples at Kaleshwaram, Srisailam, and Draksharamam.
                 A more historical reasoning is that during the reign of Nizams, 
                 the region was known as Telugu Angana to differentiate it from the areas where Marathi was spoken.
